       - "with my sister/girlfriend/mom/daughter/wife" → women
       - "with my brother/boyfriend/dad/son/husband" → men
       - "for her/she/woman" → women

       - "premium/expensive/high-end" → [100, 200]
    6. IMPORTANT: For Categories (SubCategories), ONLY apply a subcategory if it is explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by specific item types (e.g., 'mat' implies 'equipment', 'shoes' implies 'footwear'). DO NOT add 'equipment' by default or for general terms like 'gear' or 'items'.

    Return a JSON object with ONLY the filters mentioned in the command AND that match the available options.
    IMPORTANT: Use EXACTLY these keys in your response:
    {

      "brands": [],
      "subCategories": [],

       - "remove/delete/take off/get rid of/eliminate/take away"
       - "I don't want to see/show ... anymore"
       - "stop showing me ..."
       - "exclude/filter out/hide ..."
       - "no more ..."

    2. Pay attention to filter-specific removal patterns:
       - COLOR removal: "no more red items", "remove the blue filter", "I don't want green anymore"
       - SIZE removal: "take off the small size", "remove medium", "no more large"
       - GENDER removal: "stop showing women's items", "no more men's products"

       - "undo the filter I just added"
       - "get rid of what I just filtered for"
       - "remove those filters"

      "materials": [],
      "genders": [],
      "brands": [],
      "subCategories": [],
      "price": true/false
    }
    
    Where:
    - "isRemoveFilter" indicates if this is a filter removal request (true/false)
    - Arrays should contain ONLY the specific values to remove, not all values
    - For price, set to true if the user wants to remove the price filter, false otherwise
    
    CRITICAL: Return all values in lowercase for consistency.
    If no filter removal was detected, set "isRemoveFilter" to false.

       NOTE: This ONLY applies when viewing a specific product detail page

       Examples: "show me the running shoes", "I want to see the yoga mat", "tell me about the blue leggings", "describe the gym tank"
    
    7. "remove_filter" - User wants to remove specific filters
       Examples: "remove the red filter", "take off size small", "get rid of price range"

        Examples: miscellaneous commands that don't fit other categories
    
    DISAMBIGUATION RULES:
    - For combined intents (like "show me running clothes for women"), use these priorities:
      1. If it mentions a category (gym, yoga, running) AND filters → "category_navigation"
      2. If it mentions removing specific filters → "remove_filter"
      3. If it mentions applying new filters → "apply_filter"
    
    - For ambiguous commands like "I need a medium", determine the context:
      1. If on a product page → "product_action"
      2. Otherwise → "apply_filter"
    
    - For general shopping phrases, use these rules:
      1. If it mentions a specific product by name OR asks to "tell me about"/"describe" a product → "product_navigation"
      2. If it mentions a category (gym, yoga, running) → "category_navigation"
      3. If it mentions characteristics (color, size, gender) → "apply_filter"
    
    INFERENCE GUIDELINES:
    - "I am running with my sister" → "category_navigation" (running + women's context)
    - "Show me men's blue shirts" → "apply_filter" (applying multiple filters)
    - "I don't want to see the red ones anymore" → "remove_filter" (removing a filter)
    - "Go back to the previous page" → "navigation" (navigating back)
    - "Add this to my cart" → "product_action" (if on product page)
    - "My credit card is 1234..." → "user_info" (providing payment info)
    - "Tell me about the black running shoes" → "product_navigation"
    
    NOTE: Input may be in Arabic. Classify the intent regardless of language.

    Return ONLY the intent category name as a string, nothing else. 
    Examples: "navigation", "apply_filter", "category_navigation", etc.
    DO NOT include explanations, JSON formatting, or any other text.
