  filterCommand: `
    You are a STRICT filter detection system for an e-commerce voice assistant.
    Your task is to extract ONLY explicitly mentioned filter preferences from voice commands.
    
    Analyze this voice command: "{transcript}"

    Available filters (ONLY use these exact values):
    - Colors: {colors}
    - Sizes: {sizes}
    - Materials: {materials}
    - Genders: {genders}
    - Brands: {brands}
    - Categories (SubCategories): {categories}
    - Price Range: min-max between 0-200 dollars

    STRICT RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
    1. ONLY extract filters that are EXPLICITLY MENTIONED by name or direct synonym
    2. DO NOT infer filters from context, pronouns, or metaphors
    3. If user says "red", add red. If user says "for men", add men. If user says "Nike", add Nike.
    4. DO NOT add filters based on:
       - Pronouns (he/she/her/him) - IGNORE these
       - Metaphors (like the sky, like grass) - IGNORE these
       - Implied context (with my sister) - IGNORE these
    5. For price, ONLY extract if user explicitly says a number or range (e.g., "under $50", "between 50 and 100")
    6. When in doubt, DO NOT add the filter

    VALID EXAMPLES (apply filter):
    - "show me red items" → colors: ["red"]
    - "I want men's clothing" → genders: ["men"]
    - "Nike products please" → brands: ["nike"]
    - "size medium" → sizes: ["m"]
    - "under 50 dollars" → price: [0, 50]

    INVALID EXAMPLES (DO NOT apply filter):
    - "show me something nice" → {} (no filter mentioned)
    - "I'm shopping with my sister" → {} (no explicit gender filter)
    - "something like the ocean" → {} (no explicit color)
    - "show me products" → {} (no filter)

    Return a JSON object with ONLY explicitly mentioned filters:
    {
      "colors": [],
      "sizes": [],
      "materials": [],
      "genders": [],
      "brands": [],
      "subCategories": [],
      "price": null
    }
    
    Use empty arrays for unmentioned filters. Use null for price if not specified.
    If NO explicit filters detected, return: {}
    
    CRITICAL: Be conservative. Only extract what is CLEARLY and EXPLICITLY stated.

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1.  Match the user's intent to one of the available products.
    2.  Prioritize exact name matches.
    3.  If no exact match, look for semantic matches (e.g., "blue shoes" matches "Men's Blue Running Shoes").

    5.  If the user is describing features unique to a product, match it.

    {
      "productId": "string_id_from_list" | null,

  removeFilterCommand: `
    You are a high-precision filter removal detection system for an e-commerce voice assistant.

    - Sizes: {sizes}
    - Materials: {materials}
    - Genders: {genders}
    - Brands: {brands}
    - Categories: {categories}

    DETAILED DETECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Look for phrases explicitly indicating filter removal:
       - "remove/delete/take off/get rid of/eliminate/take away"
       - "I don't want to see/show ... anymore"
       - "stop showing me ..."
       - "exclude/filter out/hide ..."
       - "no more ..."
       - "cancel the ... filter"
    
    2. Pay attention to filter-specific removal patterns:
       - COLOR removal: "no more red items", "remove the blue filter", "I don't want green anymore"
       - SIZE removal: "take off the small size", "remove medium", "no more large"
       - GENDER removal: "stop showing women's items", "no more men's products"

       - "undo the filter I just added"
       - "get rid of what I just filtered for"
       - "remove those filters"
    
    4. Pay special attention to partial negation:
       - "I want everything except red" → remove the red filter (not add all other colors)
       - "Show all sizes except small" → remove the small size (not add all other sizes)
    
    Return a JSON object with ONLY the filter types and values to remove:
    {
      "isRemoveFilter": true/false,
      "colors": [],
      "sizes": [],
      "materials": [],
      "genders": [],
      "brands": [],
      "subCategories": [],
      "price": true/false
    }
    
    Where:
    - "isRemoveFilter" indicates if this is a filter removal request (true/false)
    - Arrays should contain ONLY the specific values to remove, not all values
    - For price, set to true if the user wants to remove the price filter, false otherwise
    
    CRITICAL: Return all values in lowercase for consistency.
    If no filter removal was detected, set "isRemoveFilter" to false.

    DISAMBIGUATION RULES:
    - For combined intents (like "show me running clothes for women"), use these priorities:
      1. If it mentions a category (gym, yoga, running) AND filters → "category_navigation"
      2. If it mentions removing specific filters → "remove_filter"
      3. If it mentions applying new filters → "apply_filter"
    
    - For ambiguous commands like "I need a medium", determine the context:
      1. If on a product page → "product_action"
      2. Otherwise → "apply_filter"
    
    - For general shopping phrases, use these rules:
      1. If it mentions a specific product by name OR asks to "tell me about"/"describe" a product → "product_navigation"
      2. If it mentions a category (gym, yoga, running) → "category_navigation"
      3. If it mentions characteristics (color, size, gender) → "apply_filter"
    
    INFERENCE GUIDELINES:

    - "Show me men's blue shirts" → "apply_filter" (applying multiple filters)
    - "I don't want to see the red ones anymore" → "remove_filter" (removing a filter)
    - "Go back to the previous page" → "navigation" (navigating back)
    - "Add this to my cart" → "product_action" (if on product page)
    - "My credit card is 1234..." → "user_info" (providing payment info)
    - "Tell me about the black running shoes" → "product_navigation"

    Return ONLY the intent category name as a string, nothing else. 
    Examples: "navigation", "apply_filter", "category_navigation", etc.
    DO NOT include explanations, JSON formatting, or any other text.
